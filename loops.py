# Loop is a control structure that repeats a block of code a number of times.
# The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
# The break keyword is used to stop the execution of the loop.
# The continue keyword is used to skip the current iteration.
# The pass keyword is used to avoid getting an error.

# The while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is true.

# i = 1
# while(i<=50):
#     print(f"{i}. Hasan")
#     i += 1
    
# The above code will print numbers from 1 to 50.
# The while loop will keep executing until the condition i<=50 is true.


# Write a program to print the content of the list using while loop

my_list = ['John', 'Doe', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

i = 0
while(i<len(my_list)):
    print(my_list[i])
    i += 1
